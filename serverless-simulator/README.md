## Introduction
This repository hosts the source code and development of the simulation component of the [OpenDC](https://opendc.org) project. This component is responsible for modelling and simulation of datacenters and their components. We have structured the repository into two individual subprojects:
- **[odcsim](/odcsim)**  
  A framework for discrete event simulation using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language.
- **[opendc](/opendc)**  
  A collection of models for simulating clouds, datacenters and their components using the **odcsim** framework.
