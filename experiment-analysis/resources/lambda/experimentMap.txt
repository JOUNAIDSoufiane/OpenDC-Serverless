Lambda Experiment setup:

All functions are sampled from the Azure Dataset

1. Sample of 8 different functions with different invocation patterns:
	Function 1: Timer pattern (No concurrency)
	Function 2: Regular frequent pattern (No concurrency)
	Function 3: Infrequent pattern (No concurrency)
	Function 4: Very Infrequent pattern (No concurrency)

	Function 5: Timer pattern (Concurrent invocations)
	Function 6: Regular frequent pattern (Concurrent invocations)
	Function 7: Infrequent pattern (Concurrent invocations)
	Function 8: Very Infrequent pattern (Concurrent invocations)

Experiment would run for a duration of 1440 minutes / 24 hours

Concurrent invocations will be spaced by 1s each to allow for 1s binning in cloudwatch insights

Experiment start time: 2020-08-01 05:10:27.099224
